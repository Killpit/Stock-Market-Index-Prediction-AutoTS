# Stock-Market-Index-Prediction-AutoTS
Predicting stock market index prices by using Yahoo Finance and AutoTS library

The project will use Yahoo Finance API to import live stock market data without downloading the CSV from the site. Then, AutoTS will be used to make predictions.

This project will include NASDAQ, NYSE, Russell2000, SIX, DAX, EURONEXT, BIST indexes and many other indexes from many other countries. The indexes that were added to the list will be written as we advance through the project. Even more, anyone can contribute their names to create a rich AutoTS library.
